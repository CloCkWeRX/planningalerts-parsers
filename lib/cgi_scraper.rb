require 'scraper'

# A simple Ruby wrapper around any scraper script that renders the correct XML and obeys the CGI interface
# Can use this to give php and perl, for example, the same web interface as all the other Ruby scrapers
# Performance is not really an issue so this very roundabout way of doing things is sort of okay.
